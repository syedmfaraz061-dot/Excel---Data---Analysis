# 🏷️ Adidas Sales and Profitability Dashboard (Excel)

### 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Adidas U.S. sales data** for the years **2020 and 2021**, aiming to understand how **sales channels, product pricing, and operating margins** affect overall profitability.

The goal was to identify key performance trends and provide actionable insights to improve sales strategy and profit efficiency.

---

### 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze total sales and profit by **product**, **sales method**, and **month**.
- Understand the relationship between **pricing**, **discounts**, and **profitability**.
- Evaluate the impact of **operating margin** on profit across different sales methods.
- Recommend strategies to improve **overall sales and profit performance**.

---

### 🧠 Key Insights

1. **Online sales method recorded the highest total sales ($449.66M)**.  
   - This was mainly due to having the **lowest average price per product**, likely driven by **discounts and promotions**.  

2. Despite the highest sales, the **online method generated the lowest profit**.  
   - The reason is its **highest operating margin of 46%**, indicating higher promotional or delivery-related costs.  

3. A **positive correlation between sales and profit** was observed.  
   - This shows that Adidas is **not incurring additional costs** to drive higher sales — meaning increased sales directly contribute to profit.  

4. **Pricing Strategy Insight:**  
   - If Adidas aligns **in-store and outlet prices** closer to the **online pricing strategy**, total sales and profits could rise together.  

---

### 💼 Conclusion
> The analysis suggests that Adidas can improve profitability by optimizing pricing parity across its sales channels.  
> Maintaining competitive online prices while improving cost efficiency in digital operations can sustain growth and profit margins.
